# Arduino Virtual Run App

![board](images/board.png)

Arduino Virtual Run App is an application that allows you to connect your smartphone with an Arduino board and a treadmill, and display virtual run videos from YouTube on your screen, to make your workout more fun and immersive. You can choose from different videos based on the duration, difficulty, scenery and quality of the image. 

## Installation
To use Virtual Run App, you also need to have an Arduino board connected to a WiFi module ESP8266 and a sensor connected to pin 2. You also need to upload the sketch of Arduino on the board, following the instructions shown in the Code section.

Here is a picture of the circuit to make on Arduino:

To easily connect the Arduino to the treadmill sensor I made a shield for the Arduino
